# QAOA for MaxCut — Research Prototype

[![CI](https://github.com/your-username/qaoa-maxcut-warmstart/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/qaoa-maxcut-warmstart/actions)  [![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/qiskit?color=blue)](https://www.python.org/)  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

A concise research-ready prototype implementing QAOA for the MaxCut problem with a classical warm-start. The repository is small by design (focus: clarity, reproducibility, and research-ready code) and includes scripts to compare baseline QAOA and warm-start variants on small graphs using Qiskit Aer's statevector simulator.

---

## Quick summary

- Algorithm: QAOA for MaxCut (p = 1 or 2).
- Warm-start: classical greedy or GW-style heuristic used to initialize the quantum state or parameters.
- Backend: Qiskit (Aer or BasicAer fallback for local simulation).
- Scope: small graphs (n ≈ 6–12), simulator-only, prototype for research and PhD portfolios.

## Quick start (2 minutes) ⚡

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the example experiment (saves plot to `results/`):

```powershell
python experiments/compare_runs.py
```

3. View the results image (`results/compare_runs.png`) and inspect `results/` for any CSV/JSON summaries.

## Results (qualitative)

The comparison plot below is generated by `experiments/compare_runs.py`. It shows optimization traces for baseline (random init) QAOA and warm-start strategies, with a dashed line for the classical greedy solution.

Interpretation (brief): warm-starts typically provide an early improvement in the optimizer trajectory and often match or exceed the baseline final energy for small instances. Exact behavior depends on graph instance and optimizer choice.

---

## Design & Methodology (concise)

- Cost unitary: RZZ rotations per edge (Qiskit `RZZGate`).
- Mixer: single-qubit RX rotations.
- Expectation: computed exactly from statevector probabilities (feasible for n ≤ 12).
- Classical warm-starts implemented: greedy heuristic and a lightweight GW-style randomized rounding on spectral embeddings.
- Optimizer: SciPy's `minimize` with `COBYLA` by default; callbacks record trajectories for qualitative comparison.

## Reproducibility

- Deterministic seeds are used in graph generation and classical heuristics where appropriate (see function docstrings).
- To regenerate the canonical plot:
  1. Activate venv and install requirements
  2. Run `python experiments/compare_runs.py`

---

## Limitations & Extensions

- This is a research prototype for small graphs and simulator-only experiments. Not intended for hardware benchmarking.
- Extensions: ML-driven warm-starts, noise-aware initialization, graph coarsening + refinement, and more extensive optimizer studies.
